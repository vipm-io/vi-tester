VI Tester is a software test framework for LabVIEW by [JKI](http://jki.net) that allows software developers to test their LabVIEW code (VIs). Software testing is a critical component of agile development and test driven development processes and is also critical for validating software functionality. VI Tester is based on the industry standard [xUnit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) software test architecture that is used in many other programming languages. This architecture is very flexible and powerful, but also very easy for beginners to learn.

## Usage ##

*Important: VI Tester is not a tool for testing hardware -- use [NI TestStand](http://www.ni.com/teststand/) for that.*

The VI Tester framework is composed of three parts:

- **Unit Tests** that you write to test your software application -- a unit test is just a VI that you write to test another VI
- **Graphical User Interface** for running tests -- a.k.a the "Graphical Test Runner"
- **Object-oriented Test Framework** -- the core architecture of the test framework
